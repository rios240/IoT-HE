# Practical Demonstration of Homomorphic Encryption in Fog/Cloud Computing for IoT Devices
In the modern era of interconnected devices, web services are indispensable in both personal
and business computing. These services facilitate the seamless exchange of information and control
between users, devices, and remote servers through standardized communication protocols.
However, the ubiquity of these services introduces significant security challenges, particularly when
communication takes place over public networks prone to monitoring, manipulation, and
unauthorized access.
In this context, IoT (Internet of Things) devices represent a rapidly growing segment of web
service applications. These devices generate and transmit vast amounts of data, necessitating robust
mechanisms for securing sensitive information and ensuring the integrity of communications. The
integration of fog and cloud computing architectures further amplifies the complexity, as data is
often processed and stored at multiple intermediary nodes before reaching a centralized collector or
storage location.
This project demonstrates the application of homomorphic encryption to address the security
concerns inherent in IoT-based fog/cloud computing systems. Homomorphic encryption enables
operations on encrypted data without exposing the plaintext, ensuring data privacy while supporting
computational needs. By employing Microsoft SEALâ€™s Python library, RabbitMQ as a message
broker, and secure communication protocols, the project exemplifies a practical solution for
securing IoT device communications in a fog/cloud architecture.

## Setup
1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose Plugin are installed.
2. Install Python Virtual Environment.
3. Clone this repository.

bash```
git clone git@github.com:rios240/IoT-HE.git
cd IoT-HE```
4. Create a virtual environment and install packages.

bash```
cd python
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

## Running
1. You will need at least four terminal tabs/windows open: one for running the docker container, one
for running the IoT Devices, one for running the Fog Nodes, and one for running the Data Collector node.
3. In the first tab/window start the docker container.

bash```
cd docker
docker compose up```
4. In the second tab/window start the IoT devices.

bash```
cd python/Device
source ../env/bin/activate
python3 main.py```
5. In the third tab/window start the Fog Nodes.

bash```
cd python/FogNode
source ../env/bin/activate
python3 main.py```
6. In the fourth tab/window start the Data Collector node.

bash```
cd python/DataCollector
source ../env/bin/activate
python3 main.py```

## Output
`device.py`, `fognode.py`, and `datacollector.py` output a lot of log data. Most of it can be ignored but 
pay attention to INFO logs with the message "### Published message..." and "### Received message..." as 
these log the actual data streams. On `device.py` the "### Publish message..." logs will show the 
device and plaintext number generated. On `fognode.py` the "### Received message..." logs will show the
device whose message was received and the homomorphic operation performed on the encrypted text (in this
case x^4). On `datacollector.py` the "### Received message..." logs will again show the device and the 
result of the operation as plaintext.
